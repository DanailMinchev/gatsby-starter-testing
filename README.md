## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the testing starter
    gatsby new my-testing-starter https://github.com/DanailMinchev/gatsby-starter-testing
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies.**

    Navigate into your new site's directory and install dependencies.

    ```shell
    cd my-testing-starter/
    npm ci
    ```

3.  **Run unit and structural tests.**

    After installing dependencies using `npm ci`, you can run the unit and structural tests in your site's directory.

    ```shell
    npm run test
    ```

    or you can run them in "watch" mode:

    ```shell
    npm run test:watch
    ```

    and you can update the Jest snapshots:

    ```shell
    npm run test:update
    ```

4.  **Run e2e (end-to-end), accessibility and visual tests using Cypress.**

    After installing dependencies using `npm ci`, you need to build the project to run e2e tests in `ci` mode.

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

    Then, you can run the tests using `test:e2e` which will run in `ci` mode:

    ```shell
    npm run test:e2e
    ```

    Corresponding option to update image snapshots in this mode:

    ```shell
    npm run test:e2e:update
    ```

    You can run e2e tests explicitly in `dev` mode with hot reloading:

    ```shell
    npm run test:e2e:dev
    ```

    Corresponding option to update image snapshots in this mode:

    ```shell
    npm run test:e2e:dev:update
    ```

    You can run e2e tests explicitly in `ci` mode, the same way as it runs on your Continuous Integration (CI) platform:

    ```shell
    npm run test:e2e:ci
    ```

    Corresponding option to update image snapshots in this mode:

    ```shell
    npm run test:e2e:ci:update
    ```

5.  **Run e2e (end-to-end), accessibility and visual tests using Cypress running in Docker.**

    You should have `XQuartz` installed and configured as described in [Running GUI applications using Docker for Mac](https://sourabhbajaj.com/blog/2017/02/07/gui-applications-docker-mac/)
    in case you would like to use `Cypress Test Runner` running in Docker on `macOS`.

    To run Cypress in Docker you can use similar commands as in point 4, but append `:docker` in the end.

    You can run the tests using `test:e2e:docker` which will run in `ci` mode.

    The `test:e2e:docker` command is working only on macOS and before running it you should run `. docker/setupXQuartz.sh`:

    ```shell
    . docker/setupXQuartz.sh
    npm run test:e2e:docker
    ```

    Corresponding option to update image snapshots in this mode:

    ```shell
    . docker/setupXQuartz.sh
    npm run test:e2e:docker:update
    ```

    You can run e2e tests explicitly in `dev` mode with hot reloading.

    The `test:e2e:dev:docker` command is working only on macOS and before running it you should run `. docker/setupXQuartz.sh`:

    ```shell
    . docker/setupXQuartz.sh
    npm run test:e2e:dev:docker
    ```

    Corresponding option to update image snapshots in this mode:

    ```shell
    . docker/setupXQuartz.sh
    npm run test:e2e:dev:docker:update
    ```

    You can run e2e tests explicitly in `ci` mode, the same way as it runs on your Continuous Integration (CI) platform:

    ```shell
    npm run test:e2e:ci:docker
    ```

    Corresponding option to update image snapshots in this mode:

    ```shell
    npm run test:e2e:ci:docker:update
    ```

6.  **Run automated visual tests.**

    After installing dependencies using `npm ci`, you need to build the project to run Storybook and visual tests.

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

    Then, you can run the tests using `test:visual` which will start [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer):

    ```shell
    npm run test:visual
    ```

    and you can update the Jest image snapshots:

    ```shell
    npm run test:visual:update
    ```

7.  **Run automated visual tests in Docker.**

    To run automated visual tests in Docker you can use similar commands as in point 6, but append `:docker` in the end.

    You can run the tests using `test:visual:docker` which will start [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) in Docker:

    ```shell
    npm run test:visual:docker
    ```

    and you can update the Jest image snapshots:

    ```shell
    npm run test:visual:docker:update
    ```

8.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site's directory and start the app using `develop` or `start` script,
    or if you prefer you can start it together with e2e tests in watch mode:

    ```shell
    cd my-testing-starter/
    npm run test:e2e:dev
    ```

    and you can start unit tests in watch mode in another terminal:

    ```shell
    npm run test:watch
    ```

9.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)!

    Open the `my-testing-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`.
    Save your changes and the browser will update in real time.
    The unit tests will re-run automatically and Cypress will reload the app so that you can re-trigger the Cypress tests.

10. **Git Hooks.**

    This project is using git hooks which are configured with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

    **"pre-commit" git hook**

    This hook is configured to format your code with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).
    When new files are staged and committed they will be formatted same way as `npm run format` command.

    **"commit-msg" git hook**

    Your commit messages must be compatible with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
    [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) is configured to make sure this specification is enforced.
    You can use `npm run commit` command to commit your changes which is using [prompt](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/prompt-cli) to create the commit messages.

## ‚úÖ Writing tests

There are few conventions when writing tests.

1.  **Automated Visual Testing and Storybook.**

    You can write your Storybook stories in `/stories/` directory and later you can write visual tests in `__visual_tests__/` directories.
    More information can be found [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/testing/automated-visual-testing/#example-using-puppeteer-and-jest).

## ‚úÖ Automated Visual Testing

There are two options for Automated Visual Testing:

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) with [jest-puppeteer](https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer) and [jest-image-snapshot](https://github.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) with [Cypress Image Snapshot](https://github.com/palmerhq/cypress-image-snapshot)

When creating the screenshots (image snapshots) there might be differences in font size or other platform specific rendering in the browser when running locally and on [CI](https://github.com/features/actions).

That is why it is better to run the visual tests inside [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), so that the same platform and browser is used locally and on CI.

For macOS users there is an option to run [Cypress Test Runner](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/test-runner.html#Overview) inside Docker as well.

Please see following articles:

- [Running GUI applications using Docker for Mac](https://sourabhbajaj.com/blog/2017/02/07/gui-applications-docker-mac/)
- [Run Cypress with a single Docker command](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/05/02/run-cypress-with-a-single-docker-command/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions integration

There are currently 3 GitHub Actions workflows:

- [CI](./.github/workflows/ci.yml)
  This workflow is acting as CI pipeline.

- [Deploy](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
  This workflow can be used to deploy latest `master` branch or specific commit to Netlify. Use this to deploy to preview, uat, prod.

- [Release](./.github/workflows/release.yml)
  This workflow can be used to create new release automatically.

  It will run all the tests as in [CI](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) workflow, it will create git release tag, new GitHub release and deploy to Netlify's UAT url.

  Make sure to edit [package.json and repository.url property](https://github.com/DanailMinchev/gatsby-starter-testing/blob/65398ad26afbb0604ae699811a2b5e09632b4099/package.json#L133) so that [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) works properly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Netlify integration

This app defines Netlify configuration in [netlify.toml](./netlify.toml) file.

Currently, the build and deploy process is done via [GitHub Actions integration](##%EF%B8%8F-github-actions-integration) instead of [Netlify Build](https://www.netlify.com/products/build/).

[Netlify Edge](https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/) is used to host the resources which are build and deployed by [GitHub Actions integration](##%EF%B8%8F-github-actions-integration).

### Netlify configuration

Connect the repository to Netlify by following [Deploy with Git](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#deploy-with-git) documentation.

You need to stop Netlify builds as described [here](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/stop-or-activate-builds/#stop-builds).

### Netlify GitHub configuration

You need to configure [GitHub encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) for [GitHub Actions](##%EF%B8%8F-github-actions-integration) to be able to deploy the app.

Follow the steps below:

1. Register a new `Netlify personal access token` as described in [Obtain a token in the Netlify UI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#obtain-a-token-in-the-netlify-ui) document. Copy the value.
2. Register a new `GitHub encrypted secret` as described in [Creating encrypted secrets for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).
   - `Name`: `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - `Value`: the personal access token value from step 1.
3. Register a new `GitHub encrypted secret` as described in [Creating encrypted secrets for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).
   - `Name`: `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`
   - `Value`: from the Netlify site dashboard, go to `Settings > General > Site details > Site information`, and copy the value. More information [here](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#link-with-an-environment-variable).

### Netlify deployments - GitHub Actions

Please see [GitHub Actions integration](##%EF%B8%8F-github-actions-integration) section for more information about the available options.

### Netlify deployments - Local machine

To set up your local machine with Netlify ([deployments](https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/) and [live dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/)) follow the steps below:

1. Copy [.env.example](./.env.example) file and name it `.env`:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Register a new `Netlify personal access token` as described in [Obtain a token in the Netlify UI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#obtain-a-token-in-the-netlify-ui) document. Copy the value.
3. Edit the `.env` file and add the token from step 2 to the `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` variable.
   ```
   NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token-value-from-step-2-here
   ```
4. From the Netlify site dashboard, go to `Settings > General > Site details > Site information`, and copy the `API ID` value as described in [Link with an environment variable](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#link-with-an-environment-variable).
5. Edit the `.env` file and add the app id value from step 4 to the `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` variable.
   ```
   NETLIFY_SITE_ID=your-app-id-value-from-step-4-here
   ```

Now you should be able to interact with Netlify platform from your local machine.

You can use following npm scripts with Netlify:

- `npm run develop:netlify`
  This will run local Netlify server on [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).
- `npm run develop:netlify:live`
  This will run local Netlify server with Live Share.
- `npm run deploy:preview`
  This will deploy the current local build to Draft url.
- `npm run deploy:uat`
  This will deploy the current local build to UAT url.
- `npm run deploy:prod`
  This will deploy the current local build to PRODUCTION url.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Codecov integration

Follow the steps below:

1. Copy the `Upload token` as described in the [documentation](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/about-the-codecov-bash-uploader#upload-token). Copy the value.
2. Register a new `GitHub encrypted secret` as described in [Creating encrypted secrets for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).
   - `Name`: `CODECOV_TOKEN`
   - `Value`: the personal access token value from step 1.

You can configure Codecov in [codecov.yml](./codecov.yml) file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è FOSSA integration

Please follow [official documentation](https://docs.fossa.com/docs/quick-import).
